# Demo site Next.js Streaming and Partial Prerendering

This is a demo site for showcasing the streaming and partial prerendering feature of Next.js.

Next.js 14 introduces exciting new features like streaming and partial prerendering, which can significantly enhance the performance of your web applications. With streaming, you can send parts of your page to the client as they are ready, rather than waiting for the entire page to be generated. This allows for faster load times and a more responsive user experience. Partial prerendering takes this a step further by allowing you to prerender only the parts of your page that are static, while leaving the dynamic parts to be rendered on the client side. This can lead to even greater performance improvements, especially for pages with a mix of static and dynamic content.
